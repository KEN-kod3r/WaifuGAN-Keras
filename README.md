# AnimeGAN-Keras
A Collection of my reimplemented GAN architectures which are my most favorite machine learning models.

1. Vanila GAN
2. Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty
3. StyleGAN without progressive trainning

## Datasets

Those GAN's were trained on soumik12345's dataset and danbooru dataset processed by TWDNE

btw, I also like other GAN but not yet know how to implement xD
